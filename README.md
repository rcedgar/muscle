Muscle is widely-used software for making multiple alignments of biological sequences. 

Muscle achieves highest scores on Balibase, Bralibase and Balifam benchmark tests and scales to thousands of sequences or structures on a commodity desktop computer.

Muscle supports generating an ensemble of alternative alignments with the same high accuracy obtained with default parameters. By comparing downstream predictions from different alignments, such as trees, a biologist can evaluation the robustness of conclusions against alignment variation caused by ambiguities and errors.

### Multiple structure alignment

Structure alignment ("Muscle-3D") is supported as well as conventional amino acid sequence alignment. Input for structure alignment is a "mega" file generated by the `pdb2mega` command of `reseek` (https://github.com/rcedgar/reseek).

<pre>
# for up to ~100 structures
reseek -pdb2mega STRUCTS -output structs.mega
muscle -align structs.mega -output structs.afa

# for up to ~10,000 structures
reseek -convert STRUCTS -bca structs.bca
reseek -pdb2mega structs.bca -output structs.mega
reseek -distmx structs.bca -output structs.distmx
muscle -super7 structs.mega -distmxin structs.distmx -reseek -output structs.afa
</pre>
